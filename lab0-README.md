## Lab0 - Schematic 

Draw the circuit below that represents the logic function using Kicad. Include the input and output circuitry to use switches as inputs and an LED as the output.

Remember, the clearer you draw your schematic, the easier it is to read and the more useful it is. Labelling important signals such as inputs and outputs greatly increases readability and understanding.
